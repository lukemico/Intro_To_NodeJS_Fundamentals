# Intro_To_NodeJS_Fundamentals

This repository is an experiment to understand Node JS using the Egghead.io tutorial
( https://egghead.io/courses/introduction-to-node-the-fundamentals )

Key Goals:

-   Understand the built-in features of node and how they operate
-   Learn to architect applications in such a way that allows your app to scale
-   Leverage tools and packages created by others to rapidly grow your applications features and capabilities
-   Comprehend nodesâ€™ built-in modules for communication and how to use those to extend your application interface
-   Use debugging tools to identify and resolve errors in your code Implement best-practice TDD and BDD principles to ensure your code is scalable, maintainable, and reproducible
